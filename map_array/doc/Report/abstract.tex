This is the first part of an MInf project which will span two years. In this project, we combine the ideas of contention aware scheduling, plastic programming, and skeleton programming, to create a library where incarnations of its skeletons will explicitly work together to share and optimize the use of system resources. 

We perform multiple experiments assessing the performance of our library, with the outcome that we can obtain performance improvements over traditional parallel programming. We also discuss how we could be take the project further, with both ideas for the next year of this MInf project, and for work to be done after this project is complete.
