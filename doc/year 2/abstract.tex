This is the scond part of an MInf project which has spaned two years. In this project, we investigate the performance implications of plastic parallel programs which adapt to the current state of the host system, and explicitly cooperate to share and optimize the use of system resources.

In the first year of this project, we created an example of a parallel programming library which implemented these features, and gained some promising preliminary results into it's performance. In this second year, we develop upon this further by investigating a more insteresting parallel pattern...EXPAND
