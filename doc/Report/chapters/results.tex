In this chapter of the report, we discuss the results of the experiments and their ramifications. The structure of this section mirrors that of the experiments section, so that the first results discussed will be the first experiment detailed in chapter \ref{chapter:experimental_methodology_and_program}.



\section{Experiment Results}



\subsection{Experiment 1 - Metrics Collection Overhead}

Runtime without metrics: 67862.0
Runtime with metrics:    68047.0

(*** Should I make this a graph? ***)

185ms of delay, 0.003\% of total runtime.

\subsection{Experiment 2 - Absolute Performance}

In this experiment, the total run times of three implementations are measured. One sequential implementation, a standard modern parallel implementation utilizing OMP, and our plastic implementation. Our plastic implementation is running with no plasticity for the moment, and with no messaging functionality at all. This is so it is comparable to a standard parallel implementation.

The OMP and our implementation are using a dynamic chunks schedule, with a chunk size of 500. All programs were compiled at optimization level 3.

Fig. \ref{fig:results_ex2} shows us that with a single thread, our performance is similar to a sequential implementation, and as we increase the thread count, our performance scales accordingly. Overall, this shows that our baseline implementation performs on a par with current parallel implementations, providing a good baseline performance.

Standard deviation!

(*** Should I make this a graph? Yes - different input sizes***)
