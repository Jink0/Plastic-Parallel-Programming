To properly evaluate the system, 



\section{Evaluation Methodology}

The experiments were run on an Ubuntu virtual machine, with four cores, 4096MB of memory, and the rest of the system at idle.

To evaluate the performance of the system, we need to synthesize a *** CHECK HERE *** real-world workload. One which we can scale, so we can test different sized tasks and varying task distributions. To do this we use the Collatz function to generate a CPU intensive workload. A constant starting number is used, and the sequence is repeated multiple times, to scale the workload.

Multiple different statistics can be collected for each thread:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Total runtime
	\item Time spent doing work
	\item Time spent in overhead
	\item Time blocked by main thread
	\item Number of tasks completed
\end{enumerate}
