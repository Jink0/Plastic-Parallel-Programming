This is the first part of an MInf project which will span two years. In this paper, we combine the ideas of contention aware scheduling, plastic programming, and skeleton programming, to create a library where incarnations of its skeletons will explicitly work together. We then implement multiple experiments to investigate if we can obtain any performance improvements over traditional parallel programming, finding 


***Insert results summary here. We found X, Y, Z.***.


Assess it's usefulness, 


***We have shown X, Y, Z*** 


how it could be taken further, and possibly used to implement a useful tool for programmers.

Planned for part 2 of Minf project, and other possible future work.
